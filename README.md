What is my request. Use deep learning on all flight related metrics (Take-Off) to learn about aircraft safety envelope. Ask pilot the least amount of questions per flight. fx how many PoB / Estimated weight above empty, this is my list of least amount of questions that cannot be calculated
* Fuel weight, pilot, passenger, cargo weight - rest shall be gathered or calculated by ML

Try to deep learn what is normal take-off distance and use that as baseline for future safety envelope
* How do we know when we are airborne
* What airspeed was required / desired when getting airborne
* What whas the lenght of roll-off before getting airborne 
* Maybee use sat pictures to see if runway is grass or hard surface
*   Auto identify if condition is grass or pavement
*   categorise take-off performance based on grass or pavement
* look at take-off date and time
*   Collect met data from geoposition / time and date
*   Take in account Temperature, Preassure, Rain / percipitation

3 files from Dynon Skyview - have in mind that there are 2 screens. SN5171 is First Screen with EMS (Engine monitoring System attached) This screen therefore have more data from when engine warms up- both screens always (should have) data from time of take-off

One file is Waypoints for both screens
