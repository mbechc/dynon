3 files from Dynon Skyview - have in mind that there are 2 screens. SN5171 is First Screen with EMS (Engine monitoring System attached - always have most data) 

One file is Waypoints for both screens

Always use flightdata from screen SN5171 as it has most data available.

What is my request. Use deep learning on all engine related metrics to learn about temperature deviations from standard - 4 cylinders meassured by 2 and 2 - on measuremtment point left and right

Try to deep learn what is normal take-off distance
* Use GPS to verify start-off runway
*   Maybee use sat pictures to see if runway is grass or hard surface
